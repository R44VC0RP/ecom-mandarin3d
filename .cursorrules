# Mandarin 3D E-commerce Project Rules and Memory

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Prisma (PostgreSQL)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Server Components
- Edge Runtime where possible

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict type checking enabled
- No 'any' types unless absolutely necessary
- Use interface for object types
- Use type for union types or simple aliases

### Database (Prisma)
- Always update dateUpdated when modifying records
- Use meaningful relation names
- Include proper cascading deletes
- Always handle nullable fields explicitly

### Styling
- Use Tailwind classes for styling
- Follow BEM-like naming for custom classes
- Use CSS variables for theme colors:
  - --m3d-primary: Primary brand color
  - --m3d-primary-border: Border color variant
- Dark mode support required for all components

### Components
- Use React Icons (react-icons/fa) for icons
- Server Components by default
- 'use client' only when necessary
- Props interface for all components
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading states for async components

### API Routes
- Proper error handling with appropriate status codes
- Validate input data
- Use Edge runtime when possible
- Consistent response format:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: boolean;
    data?: any;
    error?: string;
  }
  ```

### Forms
- Client-side validation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Success feedback
- Accessible inputs
- Required field indicators

## Project Structure
/app - Next.js app router pages
/components - Reusable components
/lib - Utility functions and shared code
/prisma - Database schema and migrations
/public - Static assets

## Current Features
- Product catalog
- Shopping cart
- User authentication
- Contact form
- Static pages
- Search functionality
- Collections
- Dark mode support

## Pending Tasks & Ideas
[ ] Admin dashboard for managing products
[ ] Order management system
[ ] User reviews and ratings

## Notes
- Moving away from Shopify to full Prisma implementation
- Focus on performance and SEO
- Maintain consistent dark mode support
- Keep accessibility in mind for all new features

## Environment Variables Required
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: API base URL
- Additional vars as needed for future integrations

## Commands to Remember
```bash
# Database
bunx prisma generate
bunx prisma migrate dev
bunx prisma db seed

# Development
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run lint
```

## Git Rules
- Use git commit -m "message" to commit changes and format the messages in the standard classic commit message format.
- If a new feature is added, ask the user if they want to commit it to the main branch and push. If they just say commit then run git add . & git commit -m "message", remember to be descriptive in the commit message. If they say push then run git add . & git commit -m "message" & git push.
